This is the code repository for [Learning Jupyter](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-jupyter?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785884870), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Jupyter Notebook is a web-based environment that enables interactive computing in notebook documents. It allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. The Jupyter Notebook system is extensively used in domains such as data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning, and much more.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

Julia works very differently in one environment vs another

The code will look like the following:
```
"language_info": {
"file_extension": ".js",
"mimetype": "application/javascript",
"name": "javascript",
"version": "4.2.4"
}
```

The steps in this book assume you have a modern Windows or Macintosh machine with Internet access. There are several points where you will need to install software, so you need administrative privileges to the machine to do so.
